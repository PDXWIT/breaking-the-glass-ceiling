Continuing our WIT(H) series (women in technology history), hosts Dawn Mott and Kimberly Embry celebrate Women's History Month. We highlight the stories of these women in technology: Everlyn Boyd Granville, who increased access to information and promoted education, Joan Ball, who revolutionized computer dating despite hardship, the innovative mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani, and Donna Hammond, a Portland native and electrician who work has made trades a safe place for women and diverse workers.

Do you have a mentor or someone you want us to highlight? We want to hear from you! Share your thought or feedback at [podcast@pdxwit.org](mailto:podcast@pdxwit.org) or tag us on your favorite social media platform #pdxwitpodcast.
