Ever the team player and coach, Marcus Carter joins us to talk about self-awareness and ultimately, self-acceptance. Marcus shares personal stories of realizations through conversations with his wife and moments of growth with his two daughters. He shares the steps he’s taken to get into tech throughout his career path and into his current role as a talent partner and community advocate.

There are lessons of acceptance of self and others. Marcus Carter’s inquisitive mind and non-judgemental nature enlivened our recording studio. His willingness to open up with us was inspiring. We hope this episode motivates you to bring your full, compassionate self to the office and uplift those around you where ever you go, as he did with us.
