Jesselle Hedman shares how her background in organizational communications theory helped her impact the workplace through an equity, inclusion, and diversity lens. From building out a diversity and inclusion program at Vacasa to recruiting for Thinkful, a forward thinking career accelerator program with an emphasis on student success.  

She shares the pitfalls of focusing on diversity alone, conflating diversity and inclusion, and creating solutions without communicating with the communities these efforts are attempting to solve for. Jesselle shares concrete steps organizations can take to create an inclusive environment from flexible holidays to diverse candidate pools, hiring panels, and more.  

We hope you are inspired to follow Jesselle's lead in starting conversations around equity, inclusion, and diversity, and then empowering those around you to continue them.
