Dana Lawson makes coding exciting and human interactions deep and authentic. From a modest beginning on the New Mexico - Texas border, Dana Lawson has achieved the prestigious title, VP of Engineering at GitHub. But she did not get to where she is now by simply chasing a title; she put in the work and continues to study and hone her craft.

Join us as we venture with Dana from studying Fine Arts in college, through her early years programming in the Army, to working with many startups, to where she is now. Dana gets personal with the podcast team, sharing experiences of discrimination and stories of growth and shedding ego in this technology-centric episode.
