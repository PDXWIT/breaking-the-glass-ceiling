We start our exploration into living the PDXWIT values with Max Western and Kilaa Slaughter-Scott. At PDXWIT we believe in nurturing our community through career growth and opportunities, mentorship, and skill-building events in a way that is authentic, clear, accessible and relatable. Kilaa and Max are both co-chairs of Cambia Employee Resource Groups.

Our guests share their experiences building community where none previously existed. Max Western shares their community efforts through their time spent at the kettlebell gym and work with [Smyrc](http://www.smyrc.org/). Kilaa Slaughter-Scott volunteers within her community on the board of [North by North East Community Health Center](https://nxneclinic.org/) as well as being an involved and enthusiastic mother. Enjoy this community focused episodes as we bring awareness to initiatives weâ€™d like to learn more about.
