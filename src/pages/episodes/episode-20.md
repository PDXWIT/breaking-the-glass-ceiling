Get inspired to make a difference with Ochuko Akpovbovbo, a talented student and entrepreneur, who joins us to share her passion for tech, startups, and making capital accessible for women of color. She shows us the power of being involved in the community through her work with Girls Inc., the Portland Incubator Project (PIE), and PDXWIT.


Ochuko reminds us about the importance of staying connected through community building, being willing to talk about hard things while maintaining respect for one another, how race informed her experience since coming to North America, and what ideal representation looks like.
